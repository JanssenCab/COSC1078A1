<h1>Welcome to the home page!</h1>
  <p>Hi, my name is Janssen Abatol Cabanada, or Janssen for short. I am 18 years old and was born on the 17th of February 2004 in Cebu, Philippines. As you may have guessed, I am Filipino and came and settled in Australia when I was about 5 years old on December 7th, 2009.
    <br>
    I speak two languages, Visayas (or Cebuano as people from my province usually call it) and of course English, hoping to learn many more languages in the near future such as French, Korean, and Japanese. I have a brother named Joshua and a lot, and I mean A LOT of cousins, 50+ cousins/first cousins and counting.
    <br>
  I have over 15+ aunts and uncles, 11 of them on my mother’s side of the family alone: 6 uncles and 5 aunts. On my father’s side, I have 4 great aunts and 3 great uncles.</p>

  <p>When I first came to Australia, it was like a whole new world to me. I had to meet new people, learn to speak English, learn to adapt to the new and very complex climate of Melbourne, adapt to the eating habits of the Australians and so forth.
    <br>
    I am somewhat fluent in Visayan through speaking with my family at home and only talk in English to communicate with my current friends and peers that I have met throughout my life living in Australia. I have a standardized ‘Aussie’ accent when I talk in English, however it completely dissipates when I am talking in Visayan.
    <br>
    I have a dog named ‘Botsoy’ and acquired him when he was a little puppy in 2011. My hobbies are playing video games and learning about foods around the world. The first game that I ever played was ‘Defense of the Ancients’ or ‘DOTA’ for short.
    My favourite genre of games are MOBAs (Multiplayer Online Battle Arenas) and my current favourite game is ‘League of Legends’. I also like to play sports such as badminton and basketball.</p>

  <p>Since I moved to Australia when I was really young, I didn’t really get to experience much of my culture back home and instead assimilated with the Australian culture. Things like packed lunch, consisting usually of white bread and fillings like ham and cheese were the norm for me and assumed that everywhere else had adopted that style of eating lunch as well. However, this was not the case when my family decided to go back for a holiday in 2013 and learnt that kids from ages 9 and above who were in high school actually go back home during lunch break and eat homecooked meals such as rice, meat, and soup. I have also learnt other culture differences between Australia and the Philippines during my times on holidays and trips back to my hometown. Filipinos are really into their karaoke and almost treat it as a competitive sport. Usually in big gatherings such as birthdays, there are lots of food to feed the crowd and the family would take turns singing songs and drinking till dawn and just overall having a fun time until they got tired or passed out due to the alcohol.</p>
