      <strong style="text-align: center;">What these tests mean to me</strong>
      <br><br>
      The results of these test show that I am mainly a tactile learner. Auditory learning or listening is the weakest trait of learning that I have, which doesn’t really surprise me as I have somewhat have a weak memory and sometimes zone out when someone is telling me something. I thrive off hands-on learning, also known as tactile, paired with visual learning. From experience, this is my best way of learning as I have always preferred watching others show me how it is done rather than them telling me each step. I find that it is easier for me to comprehend a task if I am following it by observing and doing motions in the air with my hands, which the test clearly show.

      <strong style="text-align: center;">How will it influence my behaviour in a team</strong>
      <br><br>
      These results may influence in the decision making in the team as the results show that I tend to act more towards emotions rather than logically. As I heavily lean towards a more on emotions, I can use it to its strengths to impact my team on a more positive note, such as hyping them up, telling them to strive through and never give up etc.</p>

      <strong style="text-align: center;">How will i take this into account when forming a team?</strong>
      <br><br>
      When forming a team, I should be looking for people that will be easy going and open to ideas, whilst being more on the theoretical side and having great auditory skills, such as handling data, creating presentations, being able to recall what was said to them with precision etc. A person with those skills paired with my skills of hands-on learning, we could cover each other’s weaknesses and complement our strengths.
