      <strong style="text-align: center;">Overview</strong>
      <br><br>
      The project that I have chosen is a computer app that users will be able to download onto their desktops to introduce and teach them the basics of any video games and video game genre. The main purpose for the app is to allow users who are new to gaming or who want to try out different game genres an easier way to learn the game as some games do not have a tutorial or are completely overwhelming for newer users. The app will include all types of games, physical or digital, game genres and will be compatible to all devices with the exception of mobile and console systems.</p>

      <strong style="text-align: center;">Motivation</strong>
      <br><br>
      As more games get released, there will always be new players who are willing to try it out regardless of gaming experience. In fact, in 2021 alone, 10’696 games were released. That is an abysmal increase in games produced per year compared to 12 years prior in 2009, which only had 350 games released that year. This app would help those gamers who are new to a genre or game and give them strategies and tips on how to improve their gameplay. By creating this app, it will give users a much better overall experience with gaming and convince those who aren’t as willing to try different games a new experience. </p>

    <br><br>

    <p><strong style="text-align: center;">Description</strong>
    <br><br>
    The app will be a software that the user can download onto their computer and run in the background, without bringing it to the foreground unless directed upon, something along the lines of other programs such as Discord. The app is compatible with any OS (Mac, Linux, Windows etc.) on any device except for mobile and console.
    <br><br>
    This product will allow the users to pull up an in-game interface when they run games and will be compatible with most game distributing services such as Steam, Epic Games and Riot games. The in-game interface will feature tutorials, tips and statistics updating in real-time. This allows users to use it to their preference and learn the basics of games that they haven’t familiarized themselves with or to improve their own gameplay using strategies and hints collated from trusted sources on the internet placed all on the app.
    The main feature of the app is the basic tutorial feature.
    <br><br>
    The tutorial feature will allow users to familiarize themselves with the game that they are playing. It will feature an overlay that is updated in real time with most games such as MOBAs (League of Legends, Dota 2) and collate data from the web to give players the best advice to quickly learn the game. The user interface will be user-friendly so that even casual gamers will not get overwhelmed whilst being compact and concise enough that it doesn’t obstruct the full gaming experience, rather give small insights on the fundamentals of the game and how to utilize it with utmost efficiency.
    <br><br>
    Alongside with the tutorial feature, the app will also include statistics and data analytics from recent matches that the user has played and compares their performance against their opponents and teammates of similar skill level, whilst helping further improve and boost their own gameplay. Furthermore, an in-app replay system will be implemented granting users their recordings from their gameplay sessions for them to look back and check how they have played.

      <strong style="text-align: center;">Tools and Technologies</strong>
      <br><br>
      The app will run mainly on the overwolf software, an all in-one platform open-source software designed by gamers, for gamers. It uses JavaScript and HTML to code apps that can be both accessed as a web application or a desktop application. As most coding software require computers, high-end computers will also be needed to keep the development completely up to date making errors and slow processing speeds redundant, increasing its overall efficiency throughout its development phase.</p>

      <br><br>

    <p><strong style="text-align: center;">Skills required</strong>
    <br><br>
    Anyone with an interest of coding and who is passionate with gaming and developing gaming apps could theoretically code the app, however at a project standpoint, qualifications, and requirements much higher are needed. Bachelors in Information Technology, Bachelors in Software Engineering or Bachelor’s in Computer Science or the equivalent will be able to work on the app.
    <br><br>
    No special hardware will be required to code this application, just hard-work, dedication, and apt knowledge on the background of the coding languages HTML and JavaScript as overwolf is reliant on the usage of those codes.
    <br><br>
    Feasibility will depend on any available hardware and any readily available employees who are willing to work on the project. Hardware will depend on any processors available on the market and how cheap they will cost as most high-end processors can cost of upwards of $1000+. Employability will also depend as different people working on the project can have different skills and ideas as the requirements are only the bare minimum required to work on the project.</p>

    <br><br>

    <p><strong style="text-align: center;">Outcome</strong>
    <br><br>
    If the fully developed app is successful, users will be able to use the app to their liking and will hopefully provide some constructive criticism and reviews to further improve the app to its absolute best. By including a tutorial feature, the problem of gamers not knowing what to do and eventually get overwhelmed when they are introduced to a new game will become redundant. Moreover, the app can also be used by competitive gamers who are looking to refine their skills and mechanics when playing.
    <br><br>
    By developing this type of app, it will be able to cater to new or casual gamers by giving them an easier way to ease into new or unfamiliar game genres without having the hassle of looking up guides on the internet which can be time consuming. Whilst it mainly caters to newer gamers, it can also be used as a tool for improvement from gamers who are desperate improve their skills or those who are heavily into the pro scene and high-level gaming, allowing feedback, statistics, and general tips on how the pros play compared to average players.
