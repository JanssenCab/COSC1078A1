      <br><br>
      I am very passionate about playing games. When I am invested into a task or a concept I will try to finish or understand that task as fast as possible and will not shy from failure and trying again. I have great verbal and written communication skills learnt from games which require heavy communication in-order to win (FPS games such as Valorant, CSGO and Overwatch are prime examples).
      <br><br>
      Also, when invested in a task, I am a quick learner and understand foreign concepts faster than others and can adapt quickly to change, such as a new work environment, meeting new friends/co-workers etc. Additionally, my ability to be prioritize work allows me to work better in a group setting and help those who are in need with problems. I thrive in an environment where I can communicate with others and can compromise to get the job done.

      <strong style="text-align: center;">Planning to obtain skills and qualifications needed:</strong>
      <br><br>
      Aside from the obvious of completing a bachelor’s degree in comp science and or software engineering, I will teach myself to learn code and coding languages required in the position (such as C++, java, python etc.) and expand my knowledge on how to apply those coding languages in a practical way. I will need to have apt knowledge of debugging and analyzation of common mistakes so I will know how to deal with them in future projects.
      <br><br>
      I will teach myself basics on game creation and the logistics behind it. I will also start to look at the physical components of consoles and computers to further understand my knowledge of their systems to prevent any major errors when I am coding/resolving the issues and to just have a better overall understanding of systems in general.
